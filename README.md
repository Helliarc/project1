# project1

This project will contain code realted to the learning of JavaScript in order to build a Discord Application.  

The "TOKEN" in code will reference my personal Discord BOT tokens, they will never be displayed and I use the environmental variables .env file to hide them. 
If you see "TOKEN", you'll need to set up your own ENV file with your Discord token, otherwise replace "TOKEN" with your own Discord Token.
